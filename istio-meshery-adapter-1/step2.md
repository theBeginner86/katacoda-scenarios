## Check for successful installation

Istio has been deployed in a separate Kubernetes namespace istio-system. To check if Istio is along with all the pieces that have been deployed, execute the following:

`kubectl get all -n istio-system`{{execute}}

The details of your configuration will also be reflected on the Meshery dashboard:
